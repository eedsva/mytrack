 Need to write a fully functionally and working code for a problem statement. Problem is to write the code for maintaining a directory for any organization where employee will have id, name, post and manager as attribute. Basically two features need to be implemented: (a). Should be able to do searching on the basis of name, prefix search for the name should also be supported, (b). For any employee, we can get the list of all the subordinates which comes under him/her, like for ceo , all the employees list should get displayed

2. No database is needed, memory storage was asked to used for this

3. Code should be extendable so that new attributes for the employee can be added

Q3: Given an array that has positive numbers and negative numbers and zero in it. You need to seperate the negative numbers and positive numbers in such a way that negative numbers lies to left of zero and positive numbers to the right and the original order of elements should be maintained

 Given 4 youtube servers which are processing user requests.
i> At any given time If someone requests for currently running videos, then return the number of videos running at a time.
ii> Which server will actually get the request ?
iii> How the servers will communicate with each other ?
iv> Other methods to do this task to reduce overhead on servers?
v> How many videos running given a time constraint ?

Given a continuous stream of strings, maintain strings such that duplicate are eliminated on the fly. The interviewer wanted working code. So coded the solution during the interview and emailed it to him 10 mins after.
So if you get “Ted”, “John”, “Mark”, “Ted”, “David”, at the moment in
time, the list should contain John, Mark, David.

Given a binary tree, how would you serialize it, store in a file and then re-creates

it again from the file ?

First I have told, heap based approach to store at 2i +1, 2i + 2 locations. Then 

I am asked to reduce space. Then with hint, I was able to store the tree as pre-
order traversal string, which also has characters to denote the NULL, and was 

able to reconstruct back using recursion.



2. Given a dataset below,

Name Score Rank

A 50 1

B 40 2

C 30 3

D 20 4

E 10 5.

Name is a string and Rank is inversely proportional to the scores.

What type of data structures would you use to store these data to perform the 

following operations ?

1. Get Name and Score Given Rank

2. Get Score and Rank Given Name

3. Update Score Given Name.

Initially told, can store Name in trie ADT and store score and rank at leaf nodes. 

Later realized it is not best approach.

Then with hint, came up with the approach of using hash for storing Name and 

array of struct for storing Score. Hash will have key, value as Name and pointer 

to the index of array.

3 operations would cost O(1), O(1) and nlogn operations respectively. We need 

to sort array each time a score is updated.

Then I was asked to reduce the complexity of 3rd operation at the cost of 1st 

operation.

Then with hint, came up with using balanced binary search tree to store the

scores.
